merb_component
=============

Merb plugin that provides composition of controllers.

Example of use:

  In config/router.rb:

    resources :posts do |post|
      post.aggregates :comments
    end
    resource :admin, :controller => :admin do |admin|
      admin.aggregates :comments
    end

  In controllers:

    class Posts < Application
      aggregates :comments

    class Admin < Application
      aggregates :show => :comments

  In views:

    Content of the user (id is 2) goes here
    <%= component Users, :show, :id => 2 %>

    Or, you can use symbol to specify subsidiary controller
    <%= component :users, :show, :id => 2 %>

    Index of posts related with the @user go here
    <% Post.related_with @user do %>
      <%= component Posts, :index %>
    <% end %>

    In app/views/posts/index.html.erb,
    You can access to the corresponding relation like this
    <%= Post.relation #=> @user %>

  For detail, you can see spec/fixture as an example.

  Enjoy!
