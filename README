=============

Merb plugin that provides composition of controllers.

Example of use:

  Content of the user (id is 2) goes here
  <%= component User, :show, :id => 2 %>

  Index of posts related with the @user go here
  <% Post.related_with @user do %>
    <%= component Post, :index %>
  <% end %>

  You can access to the corresponding relation like this
  <%= Post.relation #=> @user %>
